        <p>I am Emilia, also known as mmispot online. I am a game developer from the Netherlands, currently studying Game Development at GLU in Utrecht. I have a passion for creating games and interactive experiences, and I love to learn new skills and techniques to improve my craft. My dream is to create a game that is loved by its fanbase, and in which the passion I put into it as a developer is noticeable while playing the game.</p>
        <p>I take most of my inspiration from indie games made by small teams or even single developers. For example, ConcernedApe's Stardew Valley is not only one of my favorite games, but also a big inspiration to me regarding the Dev work.</p>
