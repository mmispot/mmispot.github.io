        <p>A 2 player local co-op game inspired by Overcooked, where the main goal is to deliver as many orders as possible before the timer runs out! Featuring a SHINY split kitchen and a group of unruly cats with a penchant for chaos, 2 players must work together to get the highest score while keeping their food (and themselves) intact.</p>
