        <p>A co-op cooking game. I programmed the interaction system and inventory system <br> using Scriptable Objects and colliders. It was made in 3 weeks time with a team <br> of 5 people, including 2 developers.</p>

        <p>I created a combiner script, the counter functionality, the entire inventory <br> system, the interact ability and the machine timers. I also worked on level-building <br> and played a big role in the team as SCRUM-Master.</p>
        <p>The biggest thing I learned from this project is the interact system. I've built an <br> inventory with Scriptable Objects before, but never a dynamic interaction system <br> that would work on different items/machines.</p>

        <p>A singleplayer shoot-em-up game. I programmed the enemies and player attacks. <br> This project was made in 4 weeks with a team of 8 students and the first project <br> I did using the SCRUM method.</p>
