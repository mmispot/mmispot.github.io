      using scriptable objects.
      The entire thing was made in 3 weeks time with a team of 2 developers and 3 artists. The biggest thing I've learned from this project is building my own dynamic interaction system. This was quite difficult but very fun to figure out. I was also appointed SCRUM-master and helped my team stay on topic, finish deadlines, give each other better feedback and started discussions.

      A twinstick shooter game made in 4 weeks with 3 developers and 5 artists. This was the first time using the new Unity Input System (Action Maps and such) and I learned a lot about setting up player controls with this new system.

      A singleplayer shoot-em-up game. I programmed the enemies and player attacks. This project was made in 4 weeks with a team of 2 developers and 6 artists. This was the first time working in a group for all of us, and the first time making a full game loop in Unity 3D. We practiced with the SCRUM-method and working in a team for the first time.
