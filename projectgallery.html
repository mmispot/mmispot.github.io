        interaction system & inventory system
      </a> 
      using scriptable objects.
      The entire thing was made in 3 weeks time with a team of 2 developers and 3 artists. The biggest thing I've learned from this project is building my own dynamic interaction system. This was quite difficult but very fun to figure out. I was also appointed SCRUM-master and helped my team stay on topic, finish deadlines, give each other better feedback and started discussions.

    <p class="slidedesc">This was the first card game I made, providing me with an oppurtunity to learn a different kind of game rather than the regular WASD movement and inventory. In class we researched deck building, mana issues and worked thoroughly on game design and code. This project was made by me alone and took 3 weeks. It's playable on both PC and mobile through <a href="https://mmispot.itch.io/c-sword" target="_blank">the web version of itch.io!</a>

      <p class="slidedesc">A singleplayer shoot-em-up game. I programmed the enemies and player attacks. This project was made in 4 weeks with a team of 2 developers and 6 artists. This was the first time working in a group for all of us, and the first time making a full game loop in Unity 3D. We practiced with the SCRUM-method and working in a team for the first time.</p>
