        <h5>Unity 3D</h5>
        <p>Throughout my entire school career, we worked almost exclusively with Unity 3D. So far I have about 2 years of experience using this engine for both 2D and 3D games.</p>
        <h5>SCRUM</h5>
        <p>During school projects, we worked using the SCRUM method. Because I'm quite an outspoken person, I took the job of SCRUM master upon me almost every project. This entailed guiding the team when needed to complete goals on time, but also set goals, ask the difficult questions, and make sure every person in my team feels heard. I absolutely love guiding my team and the role and responsibility that comes with it, and I hope to take on these same responsibilities in a bigger team in the future.</p>
